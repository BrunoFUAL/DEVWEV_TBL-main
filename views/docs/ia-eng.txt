Goals
Complement and deepen the knowledge acquired in the subjects of "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" and "Artificial Intelligence".
Learning outcomes and competencies
With this course, students are expected to acquire a better understanding of more complex problems in artificial intelligence and be able to use the correct methodology to solve them.
