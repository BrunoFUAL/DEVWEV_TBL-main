Project Management is an area of ​​knowledge that has been attracting an increasing interest from all business sectors,
 as well as by the public sector and, more recently, by the third sector.

As it is a fact that projects are the agents of change in any organization, it has become evident that the inability to manage projects
effectively and efficiently has been one of the main
obstacles to a better performance of organizations and, above all, one of the causes of the difficulty of adapting to new contexts, challenges and realities.

While in other economies it is already indisputable that a Project Manager is someone with specific training and certification in this area, in Portugal
it has only been a few years since this reality has begun to emerge more steadily. Currently, the market demand for Project Managers
with training and certification is rapidly growing and, as in other countries, in certain sectors of activity, professional Project Managers are already required,
this requirement is already present in many tender specifications.

This course seeks to provide its participants with a wide range of skills that allow them to develop their abilities to apply
the best practices within the scope of modern Project Management, while at the same time allowing them to seek to guarantee a professional certification
of the IPMA – International Project Management Association, level D, through the completion of the Certification Exam
of APOGEP – Portuguese Association of Project Management, which constitutes one of the evaluation parameters of the Course.
